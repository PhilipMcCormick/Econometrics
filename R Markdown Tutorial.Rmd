As far as text editing goes, text can be in **bold** or *italics* or use superscript^2^ or text can use ~~strikethrough~~ text. End a line with two spaces to start a new paragraph  

This is the new paragraph. It is also the 2nd paragraph. 

We can also embed links. [link](www.metacritic.com)

Equations can also be used. Inline equation: $A = \pi*r^{2}$

Images can also be added into your R markdown file. ![](C:\Users\ttung\OneDrive\Desktop\Kio.jpg)  
We can add lists of different types  

* Unordered list
* Recent video game systems purchased by Prof. Tung
  + Japanese Red Wii
  + White Wii U
  
1. Ordered List
2. Ranking of Legend of Zelda Games by metacritic score
  + Ocarina of Time
  + Breath of the Wild
  + Wind Waker 
  
R Code can always be included (R Markdown will execute the code and include the output!)

```{r}
#R Regression Estimator Example
x <- c(1100, 2550, 1700, 3400, 7200, 5600, 3900, 4500, 1400)
y <- c(1050, 1900, 1560, 2760, 6500, 5000, 3400, 4000, 1200)
data <- data.frame(i = 1: length(y), y = y, x = x)
data
plot(data$x, data$y)
abline(lm(y ~ x, data = data))
regression1 <- lm(y ~ x, data = data)
regression1

```

We can separate R code chunks with additional text! My main character in Smash Bros Ultimate is Lucina. 

```{r}
print("This is the 2nd R code chunk")
print("Professor tung's favorite Legend of Zelda game is Link's Awakening")
professor_tung_last_discgolf_scoring <- c(3, 5, 4, 3, 4, 4, 3, 4)
professor_tung_last_discgolf_scoring

```
